			<p>
				My name is Gabriela Dijkhoffz. My last name is dutch and it
				sounds like "day-coughs", kind of. I'm originally from Venezuela and
				I moved to the US in 2013. I'm a Computer Science student at University
				of Central Florida. My favorite band is Twenty One Pilots. I
				love music a lot. I play guitar, piano, and I love to sing.

				If I'm being honest, I didn't know much about code until Spring 2018.
				I began to explore the coding world and found that I loved it,
				so I switched my major to Computer Science.
				I found that I loved developing websites both front and back end. It allows
				my creativity to thrive and lets me express myself through code. Designing
				and problem solving is why I love development.
