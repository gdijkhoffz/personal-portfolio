						My name is Gabriela Dijkhoffz. My last name is dutch and it
						sounds like "day-coughs", kind of. I'm originally from Venezuela and
						I moved to the US in 2013. I'm a Computer Science student at University
						of Central Florida. My favorite band is Twenty One Pilots. I
						love music a lot. I play guitar, piano, and I love to sing.
					<p>
					<p>
						If I'm being honest, I didn't know much about code until Spring 2018.
						I began to explore the coding world and found that I loved it,
						so I switched my major to Computer Science.
						I found that I loved developing websites both front and back end. It allows
						my creativity to thrive and lets me express myself through code. Designing
						and problem solving is why I love development.
