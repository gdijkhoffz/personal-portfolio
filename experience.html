				<h3>Software Developer at UCF Center for Distributed Learning</h3>
				<h4>Oct 2018 - Current Position</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Led a team of 3 in the complete refactor of an existing Python project that automates the process of captioning educational videos for the entire university.
					</li>
					<li>
						Used a Django backend and VueJS frontend to develop a dashboard style application to hold our team's internal tools. Currently working on continuing to develop this app for our department that consists of UCF Faculty. This will allow them to access all the tools they need in their day to day in one place.
					</li>
					<li>
						Started a new team building and skill developing event called Techranger Talks. Once a week we all gather to listen to someone give a short talk on something that they have learned, think is interesting, etc. The audience gains knowledge they may not have otherwise, and our team develops speaking skills to use at conferences in the future.
					</li>
					<li>
						Contributed to an open source Python library allowing programmatic management of the Canvas Learning Management System. This Python library was created by my team previously and was my first project I ever worked on when I got hired. I wrote several APIs to cover a new endpoint and have continued to contribute to other issues involving bug fixing and performing code reviews.
					</li>
					<li>
						Assisted UCF Faculty by completing individual feature requests on their online course platform, Webcourses, using HTML and CSS.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon.com Services LLC</h3>
				<h4>May 2020 - Aug 2020</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Worked with Amazon Fashion’s Virtual Try On team to develop a full stack Java & React web appli- cation used to ensure quality and correctness of Amazon’s realistic 3D rendering of human bodies. The application displays the 3D virtual body images side-by-side at different angles.
					</li>
					<li>
						Created several multi-threaded Python programs which automate the generation and S3 upload of 3D images, as well as uploading of metadata to DynamoDB. These scripts were able to upload over 4,000 files in 5 min.
					</li>
					<li>
						Developed a test suite package for the 3D virtual body rendering application with Selenium to capture screenshots at different angles. This removed the need to manually capture and upload hundreds of images for team review.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>AFE Software Development Intern at Amazon.com Services LLC</h3>
				<h4>May 2019 - Aug 2019</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Worked with the Optimal Inventory Health team to extend an internal tool with functionality to display aggregate inventory statuses from S3 data sinks. This allowed users of the tool to review the product removal cycle from end-to-end.
					</li>
					<li>
						Implemented a Java backend to query, visualize, and update a DynamoDB table representing the statuses of the product removal decisions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Developed an Alexa Skill with AWS Lambda during a one-day hackathon enabling users to input quiz-like questions and answers, then perform quizzing sessions with live feedback.
